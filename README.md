# Forkify

Forkify is a simple sample cooking recipe website I made while learning Javascript

## Usage

Implemented features includes: 
- Searching recipe via search bar
- Viewing recipe and source website for further instructions
- Bookmarking recipes. Bookmarked recipe will be saved in the browser's local storage
- Uploading custom recipe to the API using a developer API key

## Credits

I only wrote the Javascript file(s) for this project. Credits to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/)
